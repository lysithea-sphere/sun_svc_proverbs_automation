Presider - <The owner of love> is God.  'Those whom God gave birth to' live as they love others. <Those who don't love others> are not 'people whom God gave birth to.' (Amen)

Congregation - Heaven is not made quickly. From the creation of the heavens and the earth, after God began the religious history from the Garden of Eden, He has been gradually fulfilling 'the will of love.' (Amen)

Presider - In the Old Testament, God treated 'His counterparts of love' at the level of servants; in the New Testament, He treated them at the level of children; and at the time of the 1,000-year wedding banquet, He makes the history of love. (Amen)

Congregation - You can connect with <the eternal God> only with 'love.' In every time period, God sent the person of mission whom He uses as His body, and He revealed Himself through that person. (Amen)

Presider - God loved the world 'like this.' <The greatest love> is the love He gave using the one He sent, the Messiah. (Amen)

Congregation - There is only one purpose why God loves us and helps us. It is to receive our love. God's will cannot be fulfilled if He is the only one loving us. (Amen)

Together - Love 100%! Don't think about other things, but live loving only God. Then what belongs to God will be yours. Only those who love God 100% can go to His Golden Heaven. (Amen. Hallelujah!)
